# Generating Images using DC-GAN

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for generating realistic images of handwritten digits. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of digits (0-9). DCGAN is a type of generative adversarial network (GAN) specifically designed for generating high-quality images. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to train the DCGAN model and generate new images of handwritten digits.
